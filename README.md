## Task Descriptions

The tasks cover a variety of topics, including loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations, and basic algorithms. Below is a brief description of each file:

1. **1_tank.cpp**  
   Simulates filling a tank using two buckets of different volumes (2 liters and 3 liters). Calculates the number of times each bucket is used.

2. **2_number.cpp**  
   Checks if a three-digit number is divisible by the product of its digits.

3. **3_sum.cpp**  
   Solves for a missing number in a sum equation when one of the three numbers is zero.

4. **4_boat.cpp**  
   Calculates the time required for a boat to travel a given distance, considering the speed of the current.

5. **5_pool.cpp**  
   Determines the time required to fill a pool using three taps with different flow rates.

6. **6_triplets.cpp**  
   Finds all three-digit numbers whose digits sum up to a given value.

7. **7_master_trichko.cpp**  
   Calculates the total length and maximum height of a set of rectangles.

8. **8_multiles_by_50s.cpp**  
   Prints all multiples of 50 within a given range in descending order.

9. **9_sum.cpp**  
   Computes the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.

10. **10_product.cpp**  
    Calculates the product of a sequence of numbers generated by a formula.

11. **11_gifts.cpp**  
    Finds the most expensive gift that can be bought within a budget.

12. **12_increasing_sums.cpp**  
    Computes the sum of an increasing arithmetic sequence.

13. **13_canonical_representation.cpp**  
    Outputs the canonical prime factorization of a number.

14. **14_number_of_fives.cpp**  
    Counts the occurrences of the digit '5' in numbers within a given range.

15. **15_growing_ordinance.cpp**  
    Counts numbers in a range whose digits are in strictly increasing order.

16. **16_double_digit_amounts.cpp**  
    Finds numbers divisible by a divisor formed from their digits.

17. **17_sums_of_degrees.cpp**  
    Decomposes a number into sums of powers of another number.

18. **18_no_name_solution.cpp**  
    Implements the Collatz conjecture sequence for a given number.

19. **19_addition_of_cubes.cpp**  
    Repeatedly replaces a number with the sum of the cubes of its digits until it reaches 153.

20. **20_cards.cpp**  
    Prints all cards in a deck starting from a given card number.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name

2. GitHub Copilot
Here is a README.md file for your university project:

Compile the desired file using g++:
    ```bash
    g++ -o output_file_name file_name.cpp

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
